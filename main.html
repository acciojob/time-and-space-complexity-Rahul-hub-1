	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity are two key concepts in algorithm analysis used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of execution time and memory usage, respectively.</h1>
    <p1>Time Complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as the size of the input grows. It describes how the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm increases with the input size, helping us compare the efficiency of different algorithms.</p1>
	<p2>Time complexity and <b>space complexity</b> are measures of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time and memory usage, respectively, as the size of the input (n) increases.An algorithm with O(n) time complexity performs a number of steps that grows linearly with the input size.</p2>
